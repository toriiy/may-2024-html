<p><b>Peter Pan</b> is a fictional character created by <a

        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._M._Barrie">J. M.
    Barrie</a>. A free-spirited and

    by Barrie, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_White_Bird">The Little White Bird</a></i> (1902,
    with chapters 13–18 published in <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan_in_Kensington_Gardens">Peter

    <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Wendy">Peter and Wendy</a></i>), the character has been featured
    in a variety of media and merchandise, both adapting and expanding
    on Barrie's works. These include several films, television series and many other works.</p>
<p>Barrie commissioned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan_statue">a statue of Peter Pan</a> by the
    sculptor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Frampton">George Frampton</a>, which was erected overnight in
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Gardens">Kensington

            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> Six other statues have been cast
    from the
    original mould and displayed around the world. In 2002, Peter Pan featured on a <a

    > issued
    by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Mail">Royal Mail</a> on the centenary of Barrie's creation of
    the character.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<h2>Origin</h2>
<hr>
<p>Peter Pan first appeared as a character in Barrie's <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_White_Bird">The
    Little White Bird</a></i> (1902), a novel for adults. In chapters
    13–18, titled "Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens", Peter is a seven-day-old baby and has flown from his nursery to
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Gardens">Kensington Gardens</a> in London, where the fairies and
    birds taught him to fly. He is described as
    "betwixt-and-between" a boy and a bird. Barrie returned to the character of Peter Pan, putting him at the centre of
    his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(theatre)">stage play</a> titled <i><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Wendy">Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up</a></i>,
    which premiered on 27 December 1904 at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_York%27s_Theatre">Duke of
        York's Theatre</a> in London.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>
    Following the success of the 1904 play, Barrie's publishers, <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodder_%26_Stoughton">Hodder and Stoughton</a>,
    extracted the Peter Pan chapters of <i>The Little White Bird</i> and published them in 1906 under the title <i><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan_in_Kensington_Gardens">Peter
        Pan in
        Kensington Gardens</a></i>, with the addition of illustrations by <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Rackham">Arthur Rackham</a>.<sup><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> Barrie later adapted and
    expanded the
    1904 play's storyline as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel">novel</a>, which was published in 1911 as
    <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Wendy">Peter and Wendy</a></i>.</p>
<p>J. M. Barrie may have based the character of Peter Pan on his older brother, David, who died in an ice-skating
    accident the day before his 14th birthday. His mother and brother thought of him as forever a boy.<sup><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<h2>Physical appearance</h2>
<hr>
<p>Barrie never described Peter's appearance in detail, even in his novel, leaving it to the imagination of the reader
    and the interpretation of anyone adapting the character. In the play, Peter's outfit is made of autumn leaves and
    cobwebs.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> His name and playing the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_flute">flute or pipes</a> suggest the Greek god and mythological
    character
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_(god)">Pan</a>. Barrie
    mentions in <i>Peter and Wendy</i> that Peter Pan still had all his "first teeth".<sup><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-chap1-7">[7]</a></sup> He describes him as a "lovely
    boy,
    clad in skeleton leaves and the juices that ooze out of trees".<sup><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-chap1-7">[7]</a></sup> In <i>The Little White
        Bird</i> (1902) and <i>Peter
        Pan in
        Kensington Gardens</i> (1906), he is seven days old.<sup><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Traditionally, the character has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_boy">played on stage by a
    petite adult woman</a>.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> In the
    original productions in the
    UK, Peter Pan's costume was a reddish tunic and dark green tights, such as that worn by <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nina_Boucicault">Nina Boucicault</a> in 1904.
    This costume is exhibited at Barrie's Birthplace.<sup><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> The similar costume worn by
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Chase">Pauline Chase</a> (who played the role
    from 1906 to 1913) is displayed in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_London">Museum of London</a>.
    Early editions of adaptations of the story also depict a
    red costume<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-11">[11]</a><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> but a green costume (whether or
    not made of leaves) becomes more usual from the 1920s,<sup><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> and
    more so later after the release of Disney's animated movie.</p>
<p>In the Disney films, Peter wears an outfit that consists of a short-sleeved green tunic and tights apparently made of
    cloth, and a cap with a red feather in it. He has pointed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elf">elf</a>-like
    ears, brown eyes, and reddish hair.</p>
<p>In <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_(film)">Hook</a></i> (1991), the character is played as an adult by
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Williams">Robin Williams</a>, with blue eyes and dark brown hair; in
    flashbacks to him in his youth, his hair is light brown. His ears appear pointed only when he is Peter Pan, not as
    Peter Banning. His Pan attire resembles the Disney outfit (minus the cap).</p>
<p>In the live-action <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan_(2003_film)">2003 <i>Peter Pan</i> film</a>, he
    is portrayed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Sumpter">Jeremy Sumpter</a>, with blond hair, green
    eyes, bare feet and
    a costume made of leaves and vines.</p>
<p>In the prequel to the main story <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_(2015_film)">2015 <i>Pan</i> film</a>, he
    is portrayed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi_Miller">Levi Miller</a>, a young boy who was left as a
    baby by
    the orphanage until he gets captured by Blackbeard's pirates and taken to Neverland. Here he wears just simple
    clothes.</p>
<h2>Personality</h2>
<hr>
<p>Peter is an exaggerated stereotype of a boastful and careless boy. He claims greatness, even when such claims are
    questionable (such as congratulating himself when Wendy re-attaches his shadow). In the play and book, Peter
    symbolises the selfishness of childhood, and is portrayed as being forgetful and self-centred.</p>
<p>Peter has a nonchalant, devil-may-care attitude, and is fearlessly cocky when it comes to putting himself in danger.
    Barrie writes that when Peter thought he was going to die on Marooners' Rock, he felt scared, yet he felt only one
    shudder. With this blithe attitude, he says, "To die will be an awfully big adventure." In the play, the unseen and
    unnamed narrator ponders what might have been if Peter had stayed with Wendy, so that his cry might have become, "To
    live would be an awfully big adventure!", "but he can never quite get the hang of it".<sup><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup></p>
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<hr>
<p>Peter's archetypal quality is his unending youth. In <i>Peter and Wendy</i>, it is explained that Peter must forget
    his own
    adventures and what he learns about the world in order to stay childlike.</p>
<p>Peter's ability to fly is explained, but inconsistently. In <i>The Little White Bird</i>, he is able to fly because
    he is
    said to be part bird, like all babies. In the play and novel, he teaches the Darling children to fly using a
    combination of "lovely wonderful thoughts" and fairy dust. In Barrie's Dedication to the play <i>Peter Pan</i>, <i>The
        Boy Who
        Wouldn't Grow up</i>,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> the
    author attributes the idea of fairy dust being necessary for flight to practical
    needs:</p>
<p class="margin">...after the first production I had to add something to the play at the request of parents (who thus
    showed that they
    thought me the responsible person) about no one being able to fly until the fairy dust had been blown on him; so
    many children having gone home and tried it from their beds and needed surgical attention. –
    <span class="small-text">J. M. Barrie</span></p>
<p>Peter has an effect on the whole of Neverland and its inhabitants when he is there. Barrie states that although
    Neverland appears different to every child, the island "wakes up" when Peter returns from his trip to London. In the
    chapter "The Mermaids' Lagoon" in the book <i>Peter and Wendy</i>, Barrie writes that there is almost nothing that
    Peter
    cannot do. He is a skilled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swordsmanship">swordsman</a>, rivalling even
    Captain Hook, whose hand he cut off in a duel. He has
    remarkably keen vision and hearing. He is skilled in mimicry, copying the voice of Hook and the ticking of the clock
    in the crocodile.</p>
<p>Peter has the ability to imagine things into existence and he is able to feel danger when it is near.</p>
<p>In <i>Peter and Wendy</i>, Barrie states that the Peter Pan legend Mrs. Darling heard as a child, was that when
    children
    died, he accompanied them part of the way to their destination so they would not be frightened.</p>
<p>In the original play, Peter states that no one must ever touch him (though he does not know why). The stage
    directions specify that no one does so throughout the play. Wendy approaches Peter to give him a "kiss" (thimble),
    but is prevented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell">Tinker Bell</a>. However, <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Caird_(director)">John Caird</a> and <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Nunn">Trevor Nunn</a>'s introduction to
    the script for the 1997 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_National_Theatre">Royal
        National Theatre</a> production, states that this was never Barrie's original intention, and was only added for
    a
    production in 1927, where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Forbes-Robertson">Jean Forbes-Robertson</a>
    took the title role, and played the part with a lighter, more
    fairy-like, physicality. Robertson was to play the part almost every year until 1939.</p>
<h2>Cultural allusions</h2>
<hr>
<p>The character's name comes from two sources: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Llewelyn_Davies">Peter
    Llewelyn Davies</a>, one of the five Llewelyn Davies boys who inspired
    the story, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_(god)">Pan</a>, a minor deity of Greek mythology who plays
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_flute">pipes</a> to <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nymph">nymphs</a> and is part human and part goat. This
    is referenced in Barrie's works (particularly <i><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan_in_Kensington_Gardens">Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens</a></i>)
    where Peter Pan plays pipes to the
    fairies and rides a goat. The god Pan represents Nature or Man's natural state in contrast to Civilisation and the
    effects of upbringing on human behaviour, and he experienced a significant revival of interest among English
    artists, poets and novelists during the Edwardian period.<sup>[<a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed"><i>citation needed</i></a>]</sup></p>
<p>Peter Pan is a free spirit, being too young to be burdened with the effects of education or to have an adult
    appreciation of moral responsibility. As a "betwixt-and-between", who can fly and speak the language of fairies and
    birds, Peter is part animal and part human. According to psychologist <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosalind_Ridley">Rosalind Ridley</a>, by comparing Peter's
    behaviour to adults and to other animals, Barrie raises many post-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwinism">Darwinian</a>
    questions about the origins of human
    nature and behaviour. As "the boy who wouldn't grow up", Peter exhibits many aspects of the stages of <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_development">cognitive
        development</a> seen in children and can be regarded as Barrie's memory of himself as a child, being both
    charmingly
    childlike and childishly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism">solipsistic</a>.<sup><a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup></p>
